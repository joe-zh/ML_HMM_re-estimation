# ML_HMM_re-estimation


Given HMM probability vectors represented in formats of Initial Probability, Transition Probability, and Emission Probabilities, this algorithm uses forward, backward, and forward-backward probability algorithms to maximize the probability of an text observation sequence. Probabilities are returned in the natural-log form.

Within relevant methods, relevant integer floating point preservation techniques are implemented, such as log addition and the log-sum-exp technique.
